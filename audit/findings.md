### [H-1] Lack of Message Validation Allows Unauthorized Calls and Asset Draining. An user can deposit once and withdraw to drain and steal the vault

**Description**  
The `sendToL1` function enables a signer to authorize a message containing a target address, value, and arbitrary calldata. However, there are critical vulnerabilities:  
1. **Lack of Validation for Message Contents**: The function does not verify the integrity or purpose of the `message`. An attacker could craft a malicious message to authorize a call to a malicious contract or drain assets from the contract.  
2. **Excessive Gas Costs for Malicious `data`**: The `data` field in the decoded message can contain highly complex or gas-intensive payloads, potentially causing denial-of-service (DoS) or inefficiencies.  

**Impact**  
- **Unauthorized Transfers**: An attacker can exploit the lack of message validation to drain ETH or execute arbitrary calls with funds from the contract.  
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Malicious `data` can include loops or heavy computations that consume excessive gas, potentially disrupting the contract's functionality.  

**Proof of concept**

Place the following into `.t.sol`  

```javascript  
function testUnauthorizedMessage() public {
    // Assume accounts[0] is the attacker
    address attacker = accounts[0];
    bytes memory maliciousMessage = abi.encode(attacker, 100 ether, hex"");

    // Maliciously signed by a legitimate signer
    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(signers[0], keccak256(maliciousMessage));

    // Execute the attack
    vm.prank(attacker);
    l1BossBridge.sendToL1(v, r, s, maliciousMessage);

    // Check that funds were drained
    assertEq(address(attacker).balance, 100 ether, "Attacker drained the contract");
}

function testHighGasPayload() public {
    address target = accounts[1];
    uint256 value = 1 ether;
    bytes memory heavyData = hex"600080600080600080..."; // Payload with heavy gas consumption

    bytes memory message = abi.encode(target, value, heavyData);
    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(signers[0], keccak256(message));

    // Expect DoS or failure due to excessive gas
    vm.expectRevert();
    l1BossBridge.sendToL1(v, r, s, message);
}
```  
</details>  

**Recommended Mitigation**  To prevent something like this, we need to use `useNone` or `deadline` parameters which can only be used *once*

In this code, we're adding a mapping with the nonces of each user who wants to withdraw.

```javascript
    mapping(address => uint256) public nonces; // Mapping to store the nonce of each signer
    mapping(address => bool) public signers;   // List of authorized signing addresses

    event SentToL1(address indexed target, uint256 value, bytes data, uint256 nonce);

    function sendToL1(uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s, bytes memory message) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        // Recover the signer from the signature and the nonce
        address signer = ECDSA.recover(
            MessageHashUtils.toEthSignedMessageHash(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(message, nonces[msg.sender]))), // Include the nonce in the hash
            v, r, s
        );

        // Verify if the signer is authorized
        if (!signers[signer]) {
            revert L1BossBridge__Unauthorized();
        }

        // Decode the message
        (address target, uint256 value, bytes memory data) = abi.decode(message, (address, uint256, bytes));

        // Execute the call
        (bool success, ) = target.call{ value: value }(data);
        if (!success) {
            revert L1BossBridge__CallFailed();
        }

        // Emit the event
        emit SentToL1(target, value, data, nonces[msg.sender]);

        // Increment the nonce so the same signature can't be reused
        nonces[msg.sender]++;
    }
```

1. **Validate Message Integrity**  
   Include a strict validation mechanism for the decoded `message` contents. For example:  
   ```solidity  
   require(target != address(0), "Invalid target address");
   require(value <= address(this).balance, "Insufficient contract balance");
   require(data.length <= MAX_DATA_SIZE, "Data size exceeds limit");
   ```  

2. **Add Limits on Gas Usage**  
   Implement a gas limit mechanism or restrict the complexity of the `data` payload to prevent gas abuse.  

3. **Use Domain-Specific Messages**  
   Introduce a structured message schema with a clear purpose, such as withdrawals only, and reject messages that do not comply.  

4. **Log Critical Operations**  
   Emit detailed events for message processing and decoding to aid in detecting unauthorized attempts.  





### [H-2] Missing Validation of `from` Parameter Allows Unauthorized Deposits

**Description**  
The `depositTokensToL2` function does not validate that the `from` parameter corresponds to `msg.sender`. This allows an attacker to impersonate another user and deposit tokens from their account without authorization. Additionally, the vault itself can act as the `from` address, enabling unintended behaviors such as self-depositing.

**Impact**  
- **Unauthorized Token Transfers**: An attacker can deposit tokens from another userâ€™s account, leading to potential theft.  
- **Compromised Vault Logic**: The vault acting as `from` could result in recursive deposit vulnerabilities or misuse of funds held in the vault.

**Proof of concept**  
<details>
<summary>Proof of code</summary>
Place the following into `.t.sol`

```javascript
function testUnauthorizedDeposit() public {
    // Assume accounts[0] is an attacker and accounts[1] is a victim.
    address attacker = accounts[0];
    address victim = accounts[1];
    uint256 depositAmount = 100 ether;

    // Attacker has no tokens, victim has sufficient balance
    vm.prank(victim);
    token.mint(victim, depositAmount);

    // Attacker fakes the victim's address
    vm.prank(attacker);
    l1BossBridge.depositTokensToL2(victim, attacker, depositAmount);

    // Check the balances
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(victim), 0, "Victim's balance should be drained");
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(vault)), depositAmount, "Tokens should be in the vault");
}
```
</details>

**Recommended Mitigation**  
- Ensure the `from` parameter matches the `msg.sender` by adding a check:  
  ```solidity
  require(from == msg.sender, "L1BossBridge: Unauthorized deposit source");
  ```
- Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern to prevent potential reentrancy or misuse of emitted events:
  1. Perform checks and validations first.
  2. Update state variables (e.g., recording deposits or balances).
  3. Interact with external contracts or emit events last.  



### [H-3] Unsafe Deployment of ERC20 Contracts Without Validation

**Description**  
The `deployToken` function uses the `CREATE` opcode within inline assembly to deploy a new contract from the provided `contractBytecode`. However, there are several issues:  
1. The function does not validate whether the deployment was successful (i.e., it does not check if the returned `addr` is the null address `address(0)`).
2. The function does not account for compatibility issues with ZKSync, where the `CREATE` opcode might not behave as expected due to platform-specific differences.
3. There is no validation of the `contractBytecode`, which could allow deploying malformed or malicious contracts.

**Impact**  
- **Failed Deployments**: If `addr` is not checked, the subsequent assignment to `s_tokenToAddress[symbol]` and emitted events can result in a corrupted state.  
- **Incompatibility**: On ZKSync or other Layer 2 platforms with modified EVM semantics, the deployment may fail silently, leading to unexpected behavior.  
- **Security Risks**: Malformed or malicious `contractBytecode` could lead to vulnerabilities or undesired functionality in deployed contracts.

**Proof of concept**  
<details>
<summary>Proof of code</summary>
Place the following into `.t.sol`

```javascript
function testDeployInvalidBytecode() public {
    string memory symbol = "MAL";
    bytes memory invalidBytecode = hex"00"; // Invalid bytecode

    vm.expectRevert(); // Expect the function to revert due to null address or invalid deployment
    l1BossBridge.deployToken(symbol, invalidBytecode);
}

function testZKSyncCompatibility() public {
    string memory symbol = "ZKS";
    bytes memory validBytecode = hex"60806040..."; // Valid ERC20 bytecode

    // Simulate behavior in a ZKSync-like environment (custom EVM differences)
    vm.chainId(1000); // Assume 1000 is ZKSync test chain ID

    vm.expectRevert(); // Expect failure due to compatibility issues
    l1BossBridge.deployToken(symbol, validBytecode);
}
```
</details>

**Recommended Mitigation**  
1. **Validate Deployment Success**  
   Ensure the returned `addr` is not the null address (`address(0)`):  
   ```solidity
   require(addr != address(0), "L1BossBridge: Deployment failed");
   ```
2. **Platform Compatibility**  
   Use conditional logic to adapt the deployment method based on the chain ID or Layer 2 specifics. Alternatively, specify in documentation that this function is Ethereum-specific.  
3. **Validate Bytecode**  
   Add a validation mechanism for the `contractBytecode` to ensure it represents a valid ERC20 contract (e.g., via static analysis or predefined templates).  
4. **Gas Efficiency Improvements**  
   Consider optimizing the bytecode handling in the assembly block to minimize unnecessary memory operations.
